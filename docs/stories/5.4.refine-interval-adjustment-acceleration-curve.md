# Story 5.4: Refine Interval Adjustment Acceleration Curve

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a smoother, more aggressive acceleration curve when adjusting the click interval with the mouse wheel,
**so that** I can fine-tune at slow speeds and ramp up to high speeds more effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The tiered, step-based acceleration multiplier is replaced with a smooth, inverse curve.
2. Slower scrolling results in a low multiplier, allowing for precise 1ms adjustments.
3. Faster scrolling results in a significantly higher multiplier, allowing for rapid changes in speed.
4. The new curve feels natural and responsive.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Refactor the `adjust_interval` function in `app.rs`.
- [ ] Replace the `if/else` multiplier logic with a calculation based on the `elapsed` time between scroll events.
- [ ] Implement an inverse curve (e.g., `multiplier = K / elapsed_ms`).
- [ ] Clamp the multiplier to a reasonable min/max range to ensure stability.

## Dev Notes
- This story addresses user feedback on the feel of the dynamic interval adjustment feature originally implemented in Story 2.2.

## Testing
- Manually test interval adjustment at various scroll speeds.
- Verify that slow scrolling allows for fine-tuning.
- Verify that fast scrolling results in rapid speed changes.
