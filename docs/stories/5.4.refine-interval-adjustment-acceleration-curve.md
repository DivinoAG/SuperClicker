# Story 5.4: Refine Interval Adjustment Acceleration Curve

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a smoother, more aggressive acceleration curve when adjusting the click interval with the mouse wheel,
**so that** I can fine-tune at slow speeds and ramp up to high speeds more effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The tiered, step-based acceleration multiplier is replaced with a smooth, inverse curve.
2. Slower scrolling results in a low multiplier, allowing for precise 1ms adjustments.
3. Faster scrolling results in a significantly higher multiplier, allowing for rapid changes in speed.
4. The new curve feels natural and responsive.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Refactor the `adjust_interval` function in `app.rs`.
- [x] Replace the `if/else` multiplier logic with a calculation based on the `elapsed` time between scroll events.
- [x] Implement an inverse curve (e.g., `multiplier = K / elapsed_ms`).
- [x] Clamp the multiplier to a reasonable min/max range to ensure stability.

## Dev Notes
- This story addresses user feedback on the feel of the dynamic interval adjustment feature originally implemented in Story 2.2.

## Testing
- Manually test interval adjustment at various scroll speeds.
- Verify that slow scrolling allows for fine-tuning.
- Verify that fast scrolling results in rapid speed changes.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
Gemini

### File List
- super_clicker/src/app.rs

### Debug Log References
- Initial implementation and testing.
- Adjustment based on user feedback to refine slow scroll precision.

### Completion Notes
The dynamic interval adjustment mechanism has been refactored from a tiered, step-based multiplier to a smooth, inverse acceleration curve. Initial implementation provided aggressive acceleration. Based on user feedback, the curve was further refined by introducing a `MAX_SENSITIVITY_THRESHOLD_MS`. This ensures that slow scrolling results in a 1x multiplier, allowing for precise 1ms adjustments, while faster scrolling still leverages the inverse curve for rapid changes. The changes were manually tested and confirmed by the user.
