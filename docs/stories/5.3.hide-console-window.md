# Story 5.3: Hide Console Window

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to run without a visible command prompt/terminal window,
**so that** it feels like a professional native Windows application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When launching the executable (`super_clicker.exe`), no console window should appear.
2. The application GUI should still function correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add `#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]` attribute to `src/main.rs`.
- [ ] Verify that `println!` statements (if any remain) do not cause crashes (they should just be ignored).
- [ ] Verify build and run.

## Dev Notes
- This was deferred from Epic 4 to ensure debugging capabilities via console logs were available during active development.
- Should be implemented before final release.
