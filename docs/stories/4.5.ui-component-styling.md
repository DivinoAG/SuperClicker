# Story 4.5: UI Component Styling

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to apply consistent and compact styling to all UI components,
**so that** the application has a polished and professional appearance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All `iced` widgets (Text Input, Dropdown, Checkbox, Button) use custom styling that aligns with the Frontend Specification's Component Library.
2. Components have compact heights and appropriate internal padding.
3. Visual feedback (e.g., hover, focus states) is clear and consistent.
4. The system default UI font is used throughout the application.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement custom themes and styles for `iced` widgets in `ui.rs` or a dedicated styling module.
- [ ] Define compact dimensions and padding for Text Inputs, Dropdowns, Checkboxes, and Buttons.
- [ ] Ensure consistent font usage across all UI elements.
- [ ] Apply hover and focus styling according to design principles.

## Dev Notes
- Refer to `docs/front-end-spec.md` for detailed styling guidelines and component definitions.
- This story focuses on the aesthetic and layout precision of individual components.

## Testing
- Manually inspect all UI components for consistent styling, spacing, and font usage.
- Verify hover and focus states are visually distinct and consistent.
