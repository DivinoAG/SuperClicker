# Story 4.2: Adaptive Theming & Enhanced Status Display

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to respect my system's light/dark mode settings and show a clear status,
**so that** the app integrates seamlessly with my OS and I can easily tell if it's active.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application's UI theme (colors, backgrounds) automatically adapts to the system's light or dark mode setting.
2. The "Status" display (Running/Stopped) is visually prominent with distinct colors (e.g., green for Running, neutral for Stopped).
3. All UI elements maintain sufficient color contrast in both light and dark modes (WCAG AA).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Research `iced` theming capabilities and system theme detection (e.g., Windows API).
- [x] Implement light/dark mode switching based on system settings.
- [x] Apply theme-aware styling to the main window and UI elements.
- [x] Define distinct color palettes for "Running" and "Stopped" status.
- [x] Implement status display with enhanced visual prominence and color coding.
- [x] Verify color contrast ratios for key UI elements in both themes.

## Dev Notes
- Integrated `dark-light` crate for system theme detection.
- `app.rs` now polls system theme every second and updates the internal `iced::Theme` for the application.
- Status text in `ui.rs` is color-coded: green for "Running" and gray for "Stopped".
- Iced widgets automatically adapt to the `Theme::Dark` or `Theme::Light` set by the application.

## File List
- super_clicker/Cargo.toml
- super_clicker/src/app.rs
- super_clicker/src/ui.rs

## Testing
- Changed system theme (light/dark mode) and relaunched the app; verified UI adapts correctly.
- Manually checked color contrast for status display and other elements.
- Verified status text updates correctly and color changes are applied.
