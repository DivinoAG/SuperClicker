# Story 4.2: Adaptive Theming & Enhanced Status Display

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to respect my system's light/dark mode settings and show a clear status,
**so that** the app integrates seamlessly with my OS and I can easily tell if it's active.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application's UI theme (colors, backgrounds) automatically adapts to the system's light or dark mode setting.
2. The "Status" display (Running/Stopped) is visually prominent with distinct colors (e.g., green for Running, neutral for Stopped).
3. All UI elements maintain sufficient color contrast in both light and dark modes (WCAG AA).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Research `iced` theming capabilities and system theme detection (e.g., Windows API).
- [ ] Implement light/dark mode switching based on system settings.
- [ ] Apply theme-aware styling to the main window and UI elements.
- [ ] Define distinct color palettes for "Running" and "Stopped" status.
- [ ] Implement status display with enhanced visual prominence and color coding.
- [ ] Verify color contrast ratios for key UI elements in both themes.

## Dev Notes
- Refer to `docs/front-end-spec.md` for specific theming guidelines and color palette.

## Testing
- Change system theme (light/dark mode) and relaunch the app; verify UI adapts correctly.
- Manually check color contrast for status display and other elements.
- Verify status text updates correctly and color changes are applied.
