# Story 3.1: UI for Hotkey Customization

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a UI to configure my preferred hotkeys,
**so that** I can avoid conflicts with other applications and use combinations that are comfortable for me.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main window has a clearly labeled section for "Toggle Hotkey Customization".
2. This section contains checkboxes for Ctrl, Alt, and Shift.
3. This section contains a text input field that captures a single key press.
4. The main window has a similar section for "Interval Adjustment Hotkey Customization".
5. The input field can be cleared to allow for combinations of only modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design the hotkey customization UI elements in `ui.rs`.
- [ ] Implement state management in `app.rs` for customizable hotkey combinations.
- [ ] Create components for modifier checkboxes (Ctrl, Alt, Shift).
- [ ] Implement logic for capturing single key presses in an input field.
- [ ] Implement logic to clear the single key input.
- [ ] Create the "Hotkey Configuration" UI section in `ui.rs` (derived from Story 4.3).
- [ ] Apply `AppTheme` styling to modifier checkboxes and primary key display (derived from Story 4.3).
- [ ] Implement dynamic disabling for hotkey elements based on `is_running` (derived from Story 4.3).

## Dev Notes
- This story now includes UI styling work de-scoped from Story 4.3.
- Need to consider how `iced` handles key events for customization.
- Integration with `hotkeys.rs` will be required for registering custom hotkeys.

## Testing
- Manually test UI layout and functionality for hotkey customization.
- Verify checkboxes and key input field behave as expected.
- Test clearing the key input.
