# Story 4.3: Control Grouping & Dynamic Disabling

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** related controls to be visually grouped and non-essential settings to be disabled while the clicker is running,
**so that** the UI is organized and I'm prevented from making accidental changes during operation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Primary controls (Interval Input, Mouse Button Selector) are visually grouped together.
2. Hotkey configuration elements are visually grouped separately.
3. When the auto-clicker is "RUNNING", all interactive UI elements *except* the Stop button and the current interval display (which is updated by hotkey) are disabled and appear greyed out.
4. When the auto-clicker is "STOPPED", all interactive UI elements are enabled.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement visual grouping for primary controls in `ui.rs`.
- [ ] Implement visual grouping for hotkey configuration in `ui.rs`.
- [ ] Update `app.rs` state to track if the auto-clicker is running.
- [ ] Apply `iced`'s `Element::map` or similar to dynamically enable/disable UI elements based on the auto-clicker's state.
- [ ] Ensure disabled elements are visually distinct (e.g., greyed out).

## Dev Notes
- Refer to `docs/front-end-spec.md` for visual grouping and disabling behavior.

## Testing
- Start the auto-clicker and verify that all configuration controls (interval, mouse button, hotkey settings) are disabled.
- Stop the auto-clicker and verify all controls become enabled.
- Verify that the Stop button remains enabled while running.
