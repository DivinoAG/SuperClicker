# Story 4.7: Micro-interactions and Feedback

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** subtle animations and visual cues for key interactions and state changes,
**so that** the application feels responsive and provides clear feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A subtle animation (e.g., quick fade, color transition) is applied when the application's status changes from "RUNNING" to "STOPPED" and vice-versa.
2. Interactive elements transition smoothly when becoming disabled or enabled.
3. A brief visual cue is provided when a key press is successfully captured in a hotkey input field.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement animations for status changes (e.g., color, opacity transitions).
- [ ] Apply smooth transitions for disabled/enabled states of interactive elements.
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for hotkey input capture (e.g., temporary highlight).

## Dev Notes
- Leverage `iced`'s animation capabilities where possible.
- Focus on subtle and brief animations to avoid distraction and maintain a lightweight feel.

## Testing
- Manually observe status changes, disabled states, and hotkey input for smooth transitions and visual cues.
- Verify animations are not distracting or overly long.
