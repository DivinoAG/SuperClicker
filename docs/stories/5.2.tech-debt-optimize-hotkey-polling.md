# Story 4.2: Tech Debt - Optimize Hotkey Polling

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to optimize the hotkey detection mechanism,
**so that** the application consumes fewer CPU resources and is more energy-efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The hotkey detection no longer relies on a fixed-interval polling mechanism within `app.rs`.
2. The application utilizes an event-driven mechanism for hotkey detection, if supported by the underlying `global-hotkey` crate and `iced` framework.
3. The responsiveness of the hotkey toggle remains consistent or improves.
4. CPU usage related to hotkey detection is measurably reduced (if metrics are available).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Research `global-hotkey` crate for event-driven mechanisms or asynchronous receivers.
- [ ] Research `iced::Subscription` capabilities for handling external, non-polling events.
- [ ] Implement an event-driven hotkey subscription in `app.rs`.
- [ ] Remove the `iced::time::every` subscription and `Message::Tick` handling.
- [ ] Verify hotkey functionality remains correct.

## Dev Notes
- The current implementation uses `iced::time::every(Duration::from_millis(100))` which periodically checks for hotkey events.
- A more efficient approach would be to use a blocking event listener in a separate thread that sends messages to the `iced` event loop only when an event occurs.

## Testing
- Manually test hotkey toggle functionality.
- (If possible) Monitor CPU usage of the application before and after optimization.
