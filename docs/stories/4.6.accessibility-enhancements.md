# Story 4.6: Accessibility Enhancements

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to navigate and interact with the UI using only my keyboard,
**so that** the application is accessible to users who cannot use a mouse.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All interactive UI elements are navigable via the Tab key in a logical order.
2. Interactive elements (buttons, text inputs, checkboxes) can be activated using Enter or Space.
3. Clear focus indicators are visible for the currently selected UI element.
4. Labels are programmatically associated with their respective controls for screen reader compatibility.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement logical tab order for all interactive elements.
- [ ] Ensure `iced` widgets respond to Enter/Space key presses for activation.
- [ ] Customize focus indicators to be clear and prominent.
- [ ] Investigate `iced`'s capabilities for screen reader integration and labeling.
- [ ] Ensure all labels are correctly associated with their controls.
- [ ] Investigate and resolve the underlying cause of broken tab navigation (derived from Story 4.3). This includes:
    - [ ] Reviewing `iced` event handling and `rdev` interactions.
    - [ ] Exploring alternative event subscription methods or input capturing strategies.
    - [ ] Ensuring compatibility with `iced`'s built-in focus management.

## Dev Notes
- This story now includes the investigation and resolution of the tab navigation bug de-scoped from Story 4.3. Diagnostic steps in Story 4.3 revealed the issue is not in event subscriptions, suggesting a deeper problem possibly with `iced` or its backend.
- Refer to `docs/front-end-spec.md` for WCAG AA principles.
- This will likely involve custom `iced` styling and potentially adding accessibility attributes.

## Testing
- Manually test full keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space).
- Visually inspect focus indicators.
- (If feasible) Test with a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, Narrator) to verify element labeling and status announcements.
