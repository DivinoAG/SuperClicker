# Story 4.8: Implement Robust Button Icons

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** visual icons on the Start and Stop buttons,
**so that** the UI is more intuitive and visually appealing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The "Start" button displays a clear "Play" icon alongside its text label.
2. The "Stop" button displays a clear "Stop" icon alongside its text label.
3. Icons render correctly across different system configurations (no "tofu" or broken glyphs).
4. Icon styling (color, size, alignment) is consistent with the `AppTheme` and is dynamic for enabled/disabled states.
5. No new UI regressions are introduced.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Investigate robust icon solutions for `iced` (e.g., `iced_aw`, custom font embedding).
- [ ] Integrate chosen icon solution into the project.
- [ ] Modify `ui.rs` to replace text-only buttons with icon-enhanced buttons.
- [ ] Update `theme.rs` with any necessary icon-specific styling (if not handled by the solution).

## Dev Notes
- This story addresses technical debt de-scoped from Story 4.3 ("Control Grouping & Dynamic Disabling").
- Initial attempts in Story 4.3 with Unicode characters (`▶`, `■`) resulted in rendering issues (tofu). The chosen solution must handle this reliably.
- Consider potential impact on performance and build size.

## Testing
- Manually test UI layout and functionality for icon display.
- Verify icons render correctly in both Light and Dark modes.
- Verify icons and text align properly within buttons.
- Check icon visibility in enabled and disabled states.
