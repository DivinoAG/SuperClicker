# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding and Main Window

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial Rust project structure and create a basic main window,
**so that** we have a foundation to build the application upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Rust `iced` project is created.
2. A main application window is created and can be launched.
3. The window has a title of "SuperClicker".
4. The window contains placeholder text for status.
5. The window contains a text input field for the click interval, pre-filled with a default value (e.g., "100").
6. The window contains a dropdown menu for mouse button selection with "Left", "Middle", and "Right" as options.
7. The window contains a checkbox, labeled "Enable Dynamic Interval Adjustment", which is checked by default.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize Rust project with `cargo new`
- [x] Add `iced` dependency
- [x] Create `main.rs` and `app.rs`
- [x] Implement `SuperClicker` struct and `Application` trait
- [x] Implement UI layout in `ui.rs`
- [x] Add input fields and controls per AC

## Dev Notes
- Used `iced` 0.12.
- Project structure follows standard Rust conventions.

## Testing
- Run `cargo run` to verify window appearance and controls.
