# Story 2.1: Toggle Hotkey

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to press a global hotkey to start and stop the auto-clicker,
**so that** I don't have to switch to the application window.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application uses a default global hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+F6) to toggle the auto-clicker on and off.
2. The hotkey works even when the SuperClicker application is not the active window.
3. The "Start" and "Stop" buttons in the UI are no longer present, as the hotkey is now the primary control.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `HotkeyManager` in `hotkeys.rs` using `global-hotkey`.
- [x] Register default hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+F6).
- [x] Integrate `HotkeyManager` with `app.rs`.
- [x] Implement `iced::Subscription` for hotkey event polling.
- [x] Remove UI Start/Stop buttons.
- [x] Wire hotkey event to `Message::ToggleFromHotkey` logic.

## Dev Notes
- Hotkey detection implemented via polling in `app.rs` subscription.
- `hotkeys.rs` only triggers on `HotKeyState::Released` to debounce.

## Testing
- Manually test hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+F6) to start/stop the clicker in background.
- Verify that UI buttons are removed.
