# Story 4.4: Manual Start/Stop Buttons

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** clear Start and Stop buttons in the UI,
**so that** I have a manual way to control the auto-clicker in addition to the hotkey.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main window contains a clearly labeled "Start" button.
2. The main window contains a clearly labeled "Stop" button.
3. The "Start" button is enabled only when the auto-clicker is "STOPPED".
4. The "Stop" button is enabled only when the auto-clicker is "RUNNING".
5. Clicking "Start" initiates the auto-clicking functionality.
6. Clicking "Stop" ceases the auto-clicking functionality.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add "Start" and "Stop" buttons to `ui.rs`.
- [x] Implement `Message` variants for Start and Stop button clicks in `app.rs`.
- [x] Implement enable/disable logic for the buttons based on `is_running` state.
- [x] Integrate button click messages with `clicking_engine` in `app.rs`.

## Dev Notes
- This story was fully completed as part of Story 4.3: Control Grouping & Dynamic Disabling.
- These buttons will provide an alternative control mechanism to the hotkey.

## Testing
- Verify "Start" button enables when stopped and disables when running.
- Verify "Stop" button enables when running and disables when stopped.
- Click "Start" and confirm auto-clicking begins.
- Click "Stop" and confirm auto-clicking ceases.
