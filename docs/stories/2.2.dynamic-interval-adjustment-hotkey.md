# Story 2.2: Dynamic Interval Adjustment Hotkey

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to hold a hotkey and use my mouse wheel to change the click interval,
**so that** I can adjust the click speed on the fly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application uses the user-configured hotkey for interval adjustment.
2. When this hotkey is held down and enabled, scrolling the mouse wheel up decreases the click interval (speeds up clicking).
3. When this hotkey is held down and enabled, scrolling the mouse wheel down increases the click interval (slows down clicking).
4. The interval adjustment is proportional to the scroll speed (faster scroll, larger change).
5. A checkbox in the UI allows the user to enable or disable this hotkey.
6. The interval display in the main window updates in real-time as it is adjusted.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define the hotkey combination for dynamic interval adjustment.
- [ ] Implement `rdev` listener for mouse scroll wheel events.
- [ ] Integrate hotkey detection with scroll wheel event handling.
- [ ] Implement logic to adjust click interval based on scroll direction and speed.
- [ ] Update UI interval display in real-time.
- [ ] Connect UI checkbox to enable/disable feature.

## Dev Notes
- This feature will heavily rely on `rdev` for mouse scroll events.
- Need to carefully manage state between hotkey pressed and mouse wheel events.

## Testing
- Manually test dynamic interval adjustment with the hotkey and scroll wheel.
- Verify interval changes correctly and UI updates.
- Test enabling/disabling the feature via UI checkbox.
