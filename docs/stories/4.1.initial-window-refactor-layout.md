# Story 4.1: Initial Window Refactor & Layout

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application window to be compact and non-resizable,
**so that** it takes up minimal screen space and has a professional appearance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main application window has a fixed size, determined by its content.
2. The window is not resizable by the user.
3. The window displays the application title "SuperClicker" in its title bar.
4. Elements within the window are laid out with consistent padding and margins, as per the Frontend Specification.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement fixed window size in `iced` application settings.
- [x] Disable window resizing.
- [x] Apply global padding and margins to the `ui.rs` layout.
- [x] Verify window title is correctly set.

## Dev Notes
- Fixed window size set to (400, 350) and made non-resizable in `main.rs`.
- Applied a global padding of 20 and spacing of 15 to the main column in `ui.rs`.

## File List
- super_clicker/src/main.rs
- super_clicker/src/ui.rs

## Testing
- Launched the application and verified that the window is of a fixed, appropriate size and cannot be resized.
- Confirmed that padding and margins are consistently applied.
