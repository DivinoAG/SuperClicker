# Story 4.1: Initial Window Refactor & Layout

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application window to be compact and non-resizable,
**so that** it takes up minimal screen space and has a professional appearance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main application window has a fixed size, determined by its content.
2. The window is not resizable by the user.
3. The window displays the application title "SuperClicker" in its title bar.
4. Elements within the window are laid out with consistent padding and margins, as per the Frontend Specification.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement fixed window size in `iced` application settings.
- [ ] Disable window resizing.
- [ ] Apply global padding and margins to the `ui.rs` layout.
- [ ] Verify window title is correctly set.

## Dev Notes
- Refer to `docs/front-end-spec.md` for specific layout details.

## Testing
- Launch the application and verify that the window is of a fixed, appropriate size and cannot be resized.
- Confirm that padding and margins are consistently applied.
