# Story 3.2: Logic for Custom Hotkeys

## Status
Pending

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to save the user's custom hotkey configuration and register them with the operating system,
**so that** the user's preferences are applied and persist across sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application saves the customized hotkey settings.
2. The application unregisters the old hotkeys and registers the new custom hotkeys.
3. The custom hotkeys are loaded and applied when the application starts.
4. Default hotkeys (Ctrl+Alt+F6 and Ctrl+Alt+Shift) are used if no custom configuration is saved.
5. The "Acceleration Sensitivity" setting is saved and loaded along with other settings.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `settings.rs` functionality to save/load custom hotkey configurations.
- [ ] Modify `HotkeyManager` to accept and register custom hotkey combinations.
- [ ] Implement logic to unregister existing hotkeys before registering new ones.
- [ ] Integrate custom hotkey loading with `app.rs` startup.
- [ ] Add "acceleration_sensitivity" field to `settings.rs` and implement its save/load logic.

## Dev Notes
- Leverage `serde` for saving and loading hotkey configurations.
- `global-hotkey` crate needs to be used for dynamic registration/unregistration.

## Testing
- Test saving and loading custom hotkey settings.
- Verify that custom hotkeys are active after application restart.
- Test default hotkeys are used when no custom settings are saved.
- Ensure hotkey unregistration prevents old hotkeys from working.
